        On this island I had an brief encounter that elevated my mood, a bright end to the trip. Image provided by Google Maps
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>For my last day, a free day, I decided to take the metro down to Piraeus. I was walking toward Acropoli Station and was waiting for the walk sign at the crosswalk to change. I accidentally bumped into an older Greek man, and I so I said “sorry” in Greek. I moved a few steps away, but I could see that the man was still looking at me curiously. He then said good morning in Greek and I said it back, then he pointed to my sun hood, and in return I pointed to the sun. He smiled and nodded and I could see that he understood that my hood was to protect me from the sun. In accented English, he asked me where I was from, and in my very limited Greek I told him that I was American. He smiled again and said, “You are a nice person,” and I thanked him. Then, the stoplight changed, I waved goodbye, and we went separate ways. Most tourists probably haven’t make the effort to interact with him, and so it made him happy that I tried to, which I imagine is what prompted the compliment. As for me, I felt happy to have used what little Greek I knew to communicate with a person I wouldn’t be able to otherwise, even if it was a basic interaction. This encounter, though brief, was one of my favorites on the trip and is a good example of how promoting positive communication is key to building connections and has the potential to restore good faith.</p>

<p>I now see that to flourish in an ever-expanding global community, we must work to deconstruct the mistrust from original sin and rebuild with a community-oriented mindset, and indeed, moving into post-modernity the grip of original sin is loosening on America. The open communication of the digital age has allowed for the exchange of ideas such that many people who are geographically separated from one another can engage as if they were a close community. In turn, this has inspired travel that puts people from very different walks of life in opportunities to interact with one another and build connections. As a huge global network, it is necessary to disassemble the “othering” of people: if you can view and communicate with others who are different from you and find that they are in fact not motivated by pure selfishness, then the grip of the original sin mindset loosens. Many “theys” become part of a larger, more unified “we.”</p>

</figure>

<p>I don’t know what I expected going into that theater, but any expectations that I could have had were absolutely blown out of the water. Every seat was filled, and the theater was filled with laughter–I was actually crying from laughing. I started out reading the English subtitles, but then the play became so chaotically, wonderfully absurd that I stopped trying to read and just watched. Greeks and non-Greeks alike, we were all able to share these special moments together. I was able to experience for myself the power of Greek theater; I could see how, with the whole community watching together, the theater was a central to building connections and good faith in Athens and other parts of Greece, strengthening the bonds between each individual and the whole community. I wish America had more of this. I wish we weren’t so divided. I wish that we could all laugh together, united for once, like our country’s name.</p>

</figure>

<p>Even though Kerameikos is named for the ceramics that were made here and now functional partially as a cemetary, in ancient times it was also where public feasts were held at the end of the Panathenaic festival. <em>Public</em> feasts. Modern American brains cannot process this. A feast open to the whole community where anyone can go to socialize and eat free food? The closest thing in America would be something like the 4th of July festival, but even there you have to pay for the (overpriced) food. We have made our individual-community relationship transactional. Most Americans would have the gut reaction that our communities can’t have public feasts because people would just come, stock up on free food and leave, without really making an effort to interact with those in the community around them. We assume that self-interest would prevail over community bonding, on the basis of a societally-injected belief in original sin. As a result of our lack of communal events such as public feasts, we gradually become even more divided and our communal bonds further weaken. It is a dismal cycle.</p>

<p>The most surprising thing happened today. When we were at olive oil tasting, the man leading the tasting began to praise the cultivation of olive trees. He talked about how olive trees don’t demand much of humans, unlike wheat. Wheat  requires so many resources and so much effort to grow, while olive trees are relatively low-maintenance. Even though we domesticated wheat when we began cultivating it, one could almost say that wheat domesticated humans. I began feeling deja vu: I had heard the talk of wheat domesticating humans before… And then he suddenly said that he had been reading a book, and it was called <em>Sapiens</em>, and all of us students were in shock. How had this guy halfway around the world happened to read and bring up the book that we were all supposed to read that summer for the Honors Program?!</p>

<p>Sapiens actually serves as a great example of how our small local communities have been expanding and merging together to form one large, interconnected global community, where information flows throughout and empathy is a scarce resource. Books, movies, music, and essentially anything on the internet is accessible all around the world, and ideas (like the ones in Sapiens) can spread like wildfire. Our new giant community still requires empathy to keep things from devolving into a chaos of self-interest. It’s a new challenge on a scale that we Homo sapiens have never faced before.</p>

<p><em>Sapiens</em> discussed the myths such as companies and religions that serve the purpose of unifying groups of people larger than the number of individuals one can actually know. The Oracle of Delphi served as one of the famous myths of ancient Greece. People trusted very much in the prophecies of the Oracle and even relied on them to make military decisions. This myth became so powerful in part because of the belief in divine authority. They believed that there were fundamental limitations placed on them as humans, so they couldn’t understand everything the gods knew, and some ambiguity was to be expected, making an extremely vague prophecy no less trustworthy. Regardless of whether or not this reasoning sounds silly, communities rallied under the shared belief in the myth of the Oracle, who shaped the rise and fall of empires.</p>

<p>At the Archaeological Museum of Piraeus, we learned that as mercantilism arose, the Greeks were distrustful of it as one could cheat or be cheated. In this case, the interests of the community and the individual became opposed, and suspicion of selfish motives surfaced, altering the unifying good faith. Good faith had been maintained in the old way of agriculture because you couldn’t cheat, but change was on the move and trade became increasingly popular, people become increasingly divided. Conservative farmers felt a shift in the stability of their livelihood and were at odds with those who favored trade. Opposing interest ruptured the harmony in the communities.</p>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the beautiful Aegina Island surrounded by the brilliantly blue sea and sky, we visited the Temple of Aphaea, who was worshipped for agriculture and fertility. Somehow, the conversation turned to fertility cults, which sacrificed the most favorable child in order to gain the gods’ favor for an extended period of time. Of course, in our modern American minds, it made no sense why someone would sacrifice the best of what we have; we would much prefer to give up the worst to minimize our losses and instead cling that which we hold most dear. Our understanding of sacrifice generally outlines it as a loss for the individual in order to benefit another in the community or the whole community itself, and in our mindset based on original sin everyone is out for themselves, so why would anyone want to do that? In contrast, the ancient Greeks would see whatever was a win for the community as a general win for the individual too. It also helped that they viewed the sacrifices as honorable, and they loved honor.</p>

<p>We visited Epidaurus, where people would come to be healed. In additional to attempts to cure physical ailments, there was also a large theater that could also have played a role in the patients’ mental and emotional healing. The amazing acoustics of the ancient structure, as evidenced by the clarity of Aidyn’s singing in the video, demonstrate a dedication to quality and longevity that appears to be relatively common in ancient Greek theaters (and indeed their architecture in general) yet starkly absent in modern American theaters. Perhaps that is also due to the difference in the roles of theater in ancient Greece vs modern America. In ancient Greece, theater played an important role in uniting the community through shared entertainment, while today in America it has been pushed to the sidelines, and we tend to favor more solitary forms of entertainment such as watching Youtube or Netflix. These activities can be done with others, but community-building is not an intrinsic feature of them.</p>

<p>Today we traveled to Thebes, and the most surprising moment of the whole day was when we were in the entrance to the Archaelogical Museum of Thebes and I noticed that there were Greek soldiers coming in behind us. I was really curious when I saw them, not alarmed, but I assumed that if they were here, then something had to be going on. In the USA, you don’t really see uniformed soldiers in person outside of trainings, celebrations, and actual conflicts. I asked Keti why they were here, and while thinking about her response, what strikes me is her nonchalance. She simply said, and I paraphrase, that they were here to learn, just like me. Though it shouldn’t it seems crazy and cool to me that part of their civil duty as soldiers is to learn about their country’s history. But that’s how it should be: the people defending a nation should be educated about its past so that they <em>know</em> what they’re fighting for and aren’t just blindly acting as pawns. In modern America, those who aren’t history buffs tend to set historical details in a dusty corner of the mind. What if we placed greater value in that part of or education? What if, just as it is considered an honor to physically serve our country by taking up arms, it were considered an honor to educate ourselves about our country’s past, too? I believe that we would be able to more easily progress forward together, unified under our shared story of the country we call home.</p>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>We explored the Agora, the central market, and see the Tholos, where the executive committee of the Council of the 500 stayed.  The Council of the 500 consisted of men from each of the 10 tribes who were randomly selected by drawing lots to serve for one year once in their lives. Furthermore, ancient Athenian juries were much larger than any modern ones, numbering even in the thousands of people. The principles of ancient Athenian democracy directly included a much wider variety of people in political positions (though their societal norms limited the pool to only free men). All eligible citizens would be expected to serve their community in the political realm, and it would be an honor to do so due to the value ancient Athenians placed on the community. Comparatively, in modern America it’s common for people to despise those who serve in politics and to distance themselves from that sphere. People complain about jury duty and actively try to get out of it. Many don’t even vote. We Americans, ever stubborn individuals, tend to ask not what we can do for our community but rather what our community can do for us, and if we are unsatisfied with the answer, we throw a fit. I can’t even fathom what would be possible if the U.S. were so directly led by every-day people (who could actually agree on anything); modern Americans include such a wide variety of people, and we have an extremely hard time agreeing on anything.</p>

<p>Another aspect of ancient Athenian democracy that completely confounds that of our modern America is that they would hold a vote to ostracize the most powerful person to keep them from becoming <em>too</em> powerful and ruining the democracy. This is another check on power that our society lacks. In our system, we are even supposed to do the exact opposite and vote the most popular (or in some cases less hated) candidate into power as the President.</p>

<h1 id="hidden-in-plain-sight-polygonal-masonry">Hidden in Plain Sight: Polygonal Masonry</h1>

<figure>
	<img src="/hnrs103-greece/assets/polygonal-masonry.jpg" alt="polygonal masonry: large irregular stones forming part of a relatively flat, vertical wall" />
	<figcaption>
		Like stones, we come in all different shapes and sizes.
	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>Dr. Goldman told us that a student last year observed parallels between polygonal masonry and diversity. In the spirit of collective learning, let’s see if I can build upon that. Polygonal masonry gets its strength from the diverse shapes that make up the structure, with many sides contacting one another at various angles. In a way, the differences between each block contribute to the strength of the whole wall. Similarly, the differences between individuals allow them to bring different sides to any discussion or interaction and thus contribute to the strength of the whole community.</p>

<p>So, what in a community would be like the mortar gluing the blocks together for increased stability? Good faith? Without anything physically attaching the blocks together, they could probably still stand, but the wall would be very fragile and could collapse easily. Likewise, without good faith between individuals that they all want the best for the community, a community may temporarily function, but it will likely crumble under conflict.</p>

<p>Does gravity have any place in this metaphor? For a wall, gravity is the force that helps keep the blocks together without mortar, but it will also ultimately bring the wall crashing to the ground if there is enough agitation. Perhaps fear is what plays this roll in communities? Communities can temporarily form our of fear (such as fear of a separate thing or group of people); however, when conflict arises, without good faith each individual’s fear for their own interests can break the community.</p>

<p>Who knew a pile of rocks could tell us so much about ourselves?</p>

<p>After a quiet morning to settle in and recover from the long flight, we venture out into the blistering heat to our first site. We approach and ascend the giant rock outcropping known as the Areopagus (in Greek it’s literally the Aries Rock), where the ancient Athenian military leaders met to make war decisions. Providing a grand view of the surrounding area, this position allowed them to contemplate the community that they were fighting for literally see the bigger picture. This perspective ties into the empathy woven into ancient Athenian society as these powerful individuals sought to protect their community, to which they demonstrated a proud loyalty.</p>

</figure>

<p>Walking around the neighborhood where we are staying, it surprised me to see such beautiful street art. This art adds a vibrantly colorful aesthetic to the community, traces of the vivacity of ancient Greece. In contrast, I don’t have that in my neighborhood at home. The graffiti there usually consists of scribbles, random (often obscene) words, and tags that mar the neighborhoods. Whatever gratification that the vandals reap comes at the expense of the community. As I marveled at these public works of art, I realized that I was looking at a prime example of the interests of individuals and those of the community lining up, like arrows pointing in the same direction. However, back in Auburn, Washington (and many other American towns) the arrows point in opposite directions, and a gain for one implies a sacrifice for the other.</p>

<p>Our American society operates under the underlying assumption that everyone is inherently bad but should try to be good. It is a commonly held belief among Americans, and consistent with the beliefs of modernity at large, that people are inherently selfish, always out for themselves. In our society, the individual-community relationship is defined with an individual’s interests in opposition with those of the community; in order to help the community, the individual has to make sacrifices. In contrast, pre-modern Greece did not place such a negative presumption on one’s initial characteristics; the sentiment was instead that people started out relatively neutral and could become better or worse based on their actions. In this view, since people were not born bad, they were not always acting out of self-interest. This mindset allowed the community to flourish based on a belief in good faith that individuals work toward the betterment of the community, and in many ways this strength has carried on into the present day Greece. In contrast, our American society is built upon a belief in original sin, which has created a divide between our individuals and our community. But do not despair, there is hope for us non-Greeks, as you will see.</p>
