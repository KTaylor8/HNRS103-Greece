					<p>Our American society operates under the underlying assumption that everyone is inherently bad but should try to be good. It is a commonly held belief among Americans, and consistent with the beliefs of modernity at large, that people are inherently selfish, always out for themselves. In our society, the individual-community relationship is defined with an individual’s interests in opposition with those of the community; in order to help the community, the individual has to make sacrifices. In contrast, pre-modern Greece did not place such a negative presumption on one’s initial characteristics; the sentiment was instead that people started out relatively neutral and could become better or worse based on their actions. In this view, since people were not born bad, they were not always acting out of self-interest. We are built upon original sin, which has created a divide between our individuals and our community, while ancient Athens was based on a strong sense of communal trust that allowed them to flourish and has in some ways continued on into Greek culture today. But do not despair, there is hope for us non-Greeks, as you will see.</p>

					<p>You’ll find this post in your <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory. Go ahead and edit it and re-build the site to see your changes. You can rebuild the site in many different ways, but the most common way is to run <code class="highlighter-rouge">jekyll serve</code>, which launches a web server and auto-regenerates your site when a file is updated.</p>

<p>To add new posts, add a file in the <code class="highlighter-rouge">_posts</code> directory that follows the convention <code class="highlighter-rouge">YYYY-MM-DD-name-of-post.ext</code> and includes the necessary front matter. Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.</p>

<p>Jekyll also offers powerful support for code snippets:</p>

<figure class="highlight"><pre><code class="language-ruby" data-lang="ruby"><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="p">)</span>
  <span class="nb">puts</span> <span class="s2">"Hi, </span><span class="si">#{</span><span class="nb">name</span><span class="si">}</span><span class="s2">"</span>
<span class="k">end</span>
<span class="n">print_hi</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">'Tom'</span><span class="p">)</span>
<span class="c1">#=&gt; prints 'Hi, Tom' to STDOUT.</span></code></pre></figure>
