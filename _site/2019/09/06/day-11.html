        It was a full house. The play actually didn't start for several more minutes, and so the empty seats on the sides of the theater were filled soon after I took the picture.

        This was the most absurd play I have ever seen in my life, and I loved it!

<p>I don’t know what I expected going into that theater, but any expectations that I could have had were absolutely blown out of the water. Every seat was filled, and the theater was filled with laughter–I was actually crying from laughing. I started out reading the English subtitles, but then the play became so chaotically, wonderfully absurd that I stopped trying to read and just watched. Greeks and non-Greeks alike, we were all able to share these special moments together. I was able to experience for myself the power of Greek theater; I could see how, with the whole community watching together, the theater was a central to building connections and good faith in Athens and other parts of Greece, strengthening the bonds between each individual and the whole community. I wish America had more of this. I wish we weren’t so divided. I wish that we could all laugh together, united for once, like our country’s name.</p>
