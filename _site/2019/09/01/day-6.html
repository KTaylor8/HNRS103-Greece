<p><em>Sapiens</em> discussed the myths such as companies and religions that serve the purpose of unifying groups of people larger than the number of individuals one can actually know. The Oracle of Delphi served as one of the famous myths of ancient Greece. People trusted very much in the prophecies of the Oracle and even relied on them to make military decisions. This myth became so powerful in part because of the belief in divine authority. They believed that there were fundamental limitations placed on them as humans, so they couldn’t understand everything the gods knew, and some ambiguity was to be expected, making an extremely vague prophecy no less trustworthy. Regardless of whether or not this reasoning sounds silly, communities rallied under the shared belief in the myth of the Oracle, who shaped the rise and fall of empires.</p>
