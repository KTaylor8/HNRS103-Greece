        On this island I had an brief encounter that elevated my mood, a bright end to the trip. Image provided by Google Maps

<p>For my last day, a free day, I decided to take the metro down to Piraeus. I was walking toward Acropoli Station and was waiting for the walk sign at the crosswalk to change. I accidentally bumped into an older Greek man, and I so I said “sorry” in Greek. I moved a few steps away, but I could see that the man was still looking at me curiously. He then said good morning in Greek and I said it back, then he pointed to my sun hood, and in return I pointed to the sun. He smiled and nodded and I could see that he understood that my hood was to protect me from the sun. In accented English, he asked me where I was from, and in my very limited Greek I told him that I was American. He smiled again and said, “You are a nice person,” and I thanked him. Then, the stoplight changed, I waved goodbye, and we went separate ways. Most tourists probably haven’t make the effort to interact with him, and so it made him happy that I tried to, which I imagine is what prompted the compliment. As for me, I felt happy to have used what little Greek I knew to communicate with a person I wouldn’t be able to otherwise, even if it was a basic interaction. This encounter, though brief, was one of my favorites on the trip and is a good example of how promoting positive communication is key to building connections and has the potential to restore good faith.</p>

<p>I now see that to flourish in an ever-expanding global community, we must work to deconstruct the mistrust from original sin and rebuild with a community-oriented mindset, and indeed, moving into post-modernity the grip of original sin is loosening on America. The open communication of the digital age has allowed for the exchange of ideas such that many people who are geographically separated from one another can engage as if they were a close community. In turn, this has inspired travel that puts people from very different walks of life in opportunities to interact with one another and build connections. As a huge global network, it is necessary to disassemble the “othering” of people: if you can view and communicate with others who are different from you and find that they are in fact not motivated by pure selfishness, then the grip of the original sin mindset loosens. Many “theys” become part of a larger, more unified “we.”</p>
