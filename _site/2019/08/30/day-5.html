<p>At the Archaeological Museum of Piraeus, we learned that as mercantilism arose, the Greeks were distrustful of it as one could cheat or be cheated. In this case, the interests of the community and the individual became opposed, and suspicion of selfish motives surfaced, altering the unifying good faith. Good faith had been maintained in the old way of agriculture because you couldn’t cheat, but change was on the move and trade became increasingly popular, people become increasingly divided. Conservative farmers felt a shift in the stability of their livelihood and were at odds with those who favored trade. Opposing interest ruptured the harmony in the communities.</p>

	</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>On the beautiful Aegina Island surrounded by the brilliantly blue sea and sky, we visited the Temple of Aphaea, who was worshipped for agriculture and fertility. Somehow, the conversation turned to fertility cults, which sacrificed the most favorable child in order to gain the gods’ favor for an extended period of time. Of course, in our modern American minds, it made no sense why someone would sacrifice the best of what we have; we would much prefer to give up the worst to minimize our losses and instead cling that which we hold most dear. Our understanding of sacrifice generally outlines it as a loss for the individual in order to benefit another in the community or the whole community itself, and in our mindset based on original sin everyone is out for themselves, so why would anyone want to do that? In contrast, the ancient Greeks would see whatever was a win for the community as a general win for the individual too. It also helped that they viewed the sacrifices as honorable, and they loved honor.</p>
