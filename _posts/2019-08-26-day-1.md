After a quiet morning to settle in and recover from the long flight, we venture out into the blistering heat to our first site. We approach and ascend the giant rock outcropping known as the Areopagus (in Greek it's literally the Aries Rock), where the ancient Athenian military leaders met to make war decisions. Providing a grand view of the surrounding area, this position allowed them to contemplate the community that they were fighting for literally see the bigger picture. This perspective ties into the empathy woven into ancient Athenian society as these powerful individuals sought to protect their community, to which they demonstrated a proud loyalty.

# Neighborhood Graffiti

Walking around the neighborhood where we are staying, it surprised me to see such beautiful street art. This art adds a vibrantly colorful aesthetic to the community, traces of the vivacity of ancient Greece. In contrast, I don't have that in my neighborhood at home. The graffiti there usually consists of scribbles, random (often obscene) words, and tags that mar the neighborhoods. Whatever gratification that the vandals reap comes at the expense of the community. As I marveled at these public works of art, I realized that I was looking at a prime example of the interests of individuals and those of the community lining up, like arrows pointing in the same direction. However, back in Auburn, Washington (and many other American towns) the arrows point in opposite directions, and a gain for one implies a sacrifice for the other.
