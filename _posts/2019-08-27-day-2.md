We explored the Agora, the central market, and see the Tholos, where the executive committee of the Council of the 500 stayed.  The Council of the 500 consisted of men from each of the 10 tribes who were randomly selected by drawing lots to serve for one year once in their lives. Furthermore, ancient Athenian juries were much larger than any modern ones, numbering even in the thousands of people. The principles of ancient Athenian democracy directly included a much wider variety of people in political positions (though their societal norms limited the pool to only free men). All eligible citizens would be expected to serve their community in the political realm, and it would be an honor to do so due to the value ancient Athenians placed on the community. Comparatively, in modern America it's common for people to despise those who serve in politics and to distance themselves from that sphere. People complain about jury duty and actively try to get out of it. Many don't even vote. We Americans, ever stubborn individuals, tend to ask not what we can do for our community but rather what our community can do for us, and if we are unsatisfied with the answer, we throw a fit. I can't even fathom what would be possible if the U.S. were so directly led by every-day people (who could actually agree on anything); modern Americans include such a wide variety of people, and we have an extremely hard time agreeing on anything.

Another aspect of ancient Athenian democracy that completely confounds that of our modern America is that they would hold a vote to ostracize the most powerful person to keep them from becoming *too* powerful and ruining the democracy. This is another check on power that our society lacks. In our system, we are even supposed to do the exact opposite and vote the most popular (or in some cases less hated) candidate into power as the President.

# Hidden in Plain Sight: Polygonal Masonry

Dr. Goldman told us that a student last year observed parallels between polygonal masonry and diversity. In the spirit of collective learning, let's see if I can build upon that. Polygonal masonry gets its strength from the diverse shapes that make up the structure, with many sides contacting one another at various angles. In a way, the differences between each block contribute to the strength of the whole wall. Similarly, the differences between individuals allow them to bring different sides to any discussion or interaction and thus contribute to the strength of the whole community.

So, what in a community would be like the mortar gluing the blocks together for increased stability? Good faith? Without anything physically attaching the blocks together, they could probably still stand, but the wall would be very fragile and could collapse easily. Likewise, without good faith between individuals that they all want the best for the community, a community may temporarily function, but it will likely crumble under conflict.

Does gravity have any place in this metaphor? For a wall, gravity is the force that helps keep the blocks together without mortar, but it will also ultimately bring the wall crashing to the ground if there is enough agitation. Perhaps fear is what plays this roll in communities? Communities can temporarily form our of fear (such as fear of a separate thing or group of people); however, when conflict arises, without good faith each individual's fear for their own interests can break the community.

Who knew a pile of rocks could tell us so much about ourselves?
