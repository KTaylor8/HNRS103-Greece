Today we traveled to Thebes, and the most surprising moment of the whole day was when we were in the entrance to the Archaelogical Museum of Thebes and I noticed that there were Greek soldiers coming in behind us. I was really curious when I saw them, not alarmed, but I assumed that if they were here, then something had to be going on. In the USA, you don't really see uniformed soldiers in person outside of trainings, celebrations, and actual conflicts. I asked Keti why they were here, and while thinking about her response, what strikes me is her nonchalance. She simply said, and I paraphrase, that they were here to learn, just like me. Though it shouldn't it seems crazy and cool to me that part of their civil duty as soldiers is to learn about their country's history. But that's how it should be: the people defending a nation should be educated about its past so that they *know* what they're fighting for and aren't just blindly acting as pawns. In modern America, those who aren't history buffs tend to set historical details in a dusty corner of the mind. What if we placed greater value in that part of or education? What if, just as it is considered an honor to physically serve our country by taking up arms, it were considered an honor to educate ourselves about our country's past, too? I believe that we would be able to more easily progress forward together, unified under our shared story of the country we call home.
