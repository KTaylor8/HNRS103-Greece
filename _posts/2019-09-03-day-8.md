The most surprising thing happened today. When we were at olive oil tasting, the man leading the tasting began to praise the cultivation of olive trees. He talked about how olive trees don't demand much of humans, unlike wheat. Wheat  requires so many resources and so much effort to grow, while olive trees are relatively low-maintenance. Even though we domesticated wheat when we began cultivating it, one could almost say that wheat domesticated humans. I began feeling deja vu: I had heard the talk of wheat domesticating humans before... And then he suddenly said that he had been reading a book, and it was called *Sapiens*, and all of us students were in shock. How had this guy halfway around the world happened to read and bring up the book that we were all supposed to read that summer for the Honors Program?!

Sapiens actually serves as a great example of how our small local communities have been expanding and merging together to form one large, interconnected global community, where information flows throughout and empathy is a scarce resource. Books, movies, music, and essentially anything on the internet is accessible all around the world, and ideas (like the ones in Sapiens) can spread like wildfire. Our new giant community still requires empathy to keep things from devolving into a chaos of self-interest. It's a new challenge on a scale that we Homo sapiens have never faced before.
