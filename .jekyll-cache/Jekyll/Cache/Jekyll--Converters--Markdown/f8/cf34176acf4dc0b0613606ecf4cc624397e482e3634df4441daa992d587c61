        Here we see some of the ceramics that give Kerameikos its name.

<p>Even though Kerameikos is named for the ceramics that were made here and now functional partially as a cemetary, in ancient times it was also where public feasts were held at the end of the Panathenaic festival. <em>Public</em> feasts. Modern American brains cannot process this. A feast open to the whole community where anyone can go to socialize and eat free food? The closest thing in America would be something like the 4th of July festival, but even there you have to pay for the (overpriced) food. We have made our individual-community relationship transactional. Most Americans would have the gut reaction that our communities canâ€™t have public feasts because people would just come, stock up on free food and leave, without really making an effort to interact with those in the community around them. We assume that self-interest would prevail over community bonding, on the basis of a societally-injected belief in original sin. As a result of our lack of communal events such as public feasts, we gradually become even more divided and our communal bonds further weaken. It is a dismal cycle.</p>

<!-- Add thoughts about the building in Kerameikos that was a shared living space with rooms that opened into a central area; compare to college and the community in the dorms -->
