<p>We visited Epidaurus, where people would come to be healed. In additional to attempts to cure physical ailments, there was also a large theater that could also have played a role in the patients’ mental and emotional healing. The amazing acoustics of the ancient structure, as evidenced by the clarity of Aidyn’s singing in the video, demonstrate a dedication to quality and longevity that appears to be relatively common in ancient Greek theaters (and indeed their architecture in general) yet starkly absent in modern American theaters. Perhaps that is also due to the difference in the roles of theater in ancient Greece vs modern America. In ancient Greece, theater played an important role in uniting the community through shared entertainment, while today in America it has been pushed to the sidelines, and we tend to favor more solitary forms of entertainment such as watching Youtube or Netflix. These activities can be done with others, but community-building is not an intrinsic feature of them.</p>
